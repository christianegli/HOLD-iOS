# Architecture Decision Records (ADR)

## ADR-001: SwiftUI as Primary UI Framework
**Date**: 2024-12-20  
**Status**: Accepted

### Context
Need to choose between SwiftUI and UIKit for the iOS app development.

### Decision
Use SwiftUI as the primary UI framework for HOLD.

### Rationale
- **Modern Declarative Syntax**: Cleaner, more maintainable code
- **Built-in Accessibility**: Better VoiceOver and Dynamic Type support
- **Animation System**: Smooth, performant animations crucial for breathing visuals
- **Rapid Development**: Faster MVP development with less boilerplate
- **Future-Proof**: Apple's recommended approach for new iOS apps

### Consequences
- **Positive**: Faster development, better accessibility, modern codebase
- **Negative**: iOS 16+ requirement, some advanced customizations may need UIKit bridging
- **Risk Mitigation**: Use UIViewRepresentable for complex custom components if needed

### Alternatives Considered
- **UIKit**: More mature, broader device support, but more complex for animations
- **Hybrid Approach**: Unnecessary complexity for MVP scope

## ADR-002: Core Data for Local Persistence
**Date**: 2024-12-20  
**Status**: Accepted

### Context
Need to store session history, progress tracking, and user preferences locally.

### Decision
Use Core Data as the primary data persistence layer.

### Rationale
- **Native Integration**: Seamless SwiftUI integration with @FetchRequest
- **Performance**: Optimized for iOS with automatic threading
- **Migration Support**: Built-in schema migration for future updates
- **Relationships**: Easy modeling of complex data relationships
- **Privacy**: All data stays on device by default

### Consequences
- **Positive**: Robust data management, excellent SwiftUI integration
- **Negative**: Learning curve for Core Data concepts
- **Mitigation**: Use NSPersistentContainer with CloudKit for future sync

### Alternatives Considered
- **SQLite**: Lower level, more complex integration
- **UserDefaults**: Too simple for complex session data
- **Realm**: Third-party dependency, less iOS-native

## ADR-003: MVVM Architecture Pattern
**Date**: 2024-12-20  
**Status**: Accepted

### Context
Need to structure the app architecture for maintainability and testability.

### Decision
Implement MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) pattern with Combine for reactive programming.

### Rationale
- **Separation of Concerns**: Clear boundaries between UI and business logic
- **Testability**: ViewModels can be unit tested independently
- **SwiftUI Integration**: Natural fit with SwiftUI's declarative nature
- **Reactive Programming**: Combine publishers for state management

### Consequences
- **Positive**: Clean architecture, testable code, maintainable
- **Negative**: Additional abstraction layer, potential over-engineering for simple views
- **Mitigation**: Keep ViewModels focused and avoid unnecessary complexity

### Alternatives Considered
- **MVC**: Too tightly coupled for SwiftUI
- **VIPER**: Over-engineered for app scope
- **Redux/TCA**: Too complex for MVP requirements

## ADR-004: Local-First Data Strategy
**Date**: 2024-12-20  
**Status**: Accepted

### Context
Decide on data storage and sync strategy for user sessions and progress.

### Decision
Implement local-first architecture with all data stored on device.

### Rationale
- **Privacy**: User data never leaves device without explicit consent
- **Performance**: Instant access to session history and progress
- **Offline Capability**: Full functionality without internet connection
- **Simplicity**: No backend infrastructure or authentication needed
- **Trust**: Users own their data completely

### Consequences
- **Positive**: Privacy-focused, fast performance, no server costs
- **Negative**: No cross-device sync in MVP, potential data loss if device lost
- **Future Enhancement**: CloudKit integration for Pro users who want sync

### Alternatives Considered
- **Cloud-First**: Requires backend, authentication, privacy concerns
- **Hybrid**: Unnecessary complexity for MVP

---

## ADR-005: One-Time Purchase Model
**Date**: 2024-12-20  
**Status**: Accepted

### Context
Choose monetization strategy for the app.

### Decision
Implement freemium model with one-time "HOLD Pro" purchase, no subscriptions.

### Rationale
- **User Trust**: No recurring charges, transparent pricing
- **Accessibility**: Core functionality remains free
- **Simplicity**: No subscription management complexity
- **Value Proposition**: Clear feature differentiation between free and pro
- **Market Differentiation**: Most competitors use subscription models

### Consequences
- **Positive**: User-friendly, builds trust, differentiates from competitors
- **Negative**: Lower lifetime revenue compared to subscriptions
- **Mitigation**: Focus on high-value pro features that justify one-time purchase

### Alternatives Considered
- **Subscription Model**: Higher revenue but user resistance
- **Completely Free**: No revenue model
- **Paid App**: Reduces user acquisition

## ADR-006: Minimal External Dependencies
**Date**: 2024-12-20  
**Status**: Accepted

### Context
Decide on approach to third-party libraries and frameworks.

### Decision
Minimize external dependencies, use native iOS frameworks wherever possible.

### Rationale
- **Reliability**: Fewer points of failure
- **Security**: Reduced attack surface
- **Performance**: Native frameworks are optimized for iOS
- **Maintenance**: No dependency update management
- **App Store**: Faster review process, no third-party concerns

### Consequences
- **Positive**: More stable, secure, performant app
- **Negative**: More development time for some features
- **Acceptable Trade-off**: Development time vs. long-term maintainability

### Alternatives Considered
- **Heavy Dependencies**: Faster development but maintenance burden
- **Selective Dependencies**: Only for complex features like charts (Pro version)

## ADR-007: Accessibility-First Design
**Date**: 2024-12-20  
**Status**: Accepted

### Context
Determine level of accessibility support for the app.

### Decision
Design with accessibility as a core requirement, not an afterthought.

### Rationale
- **Inclusive Design**: Breathing exercises benefit everyone, including users with disabilities
- **Legal Compliance**: ADA compliance for broader market reach
- **SwiftUI Advantage**: Built-in accessibility features
- **Competitive Advantage**: Many breathing apps have poor accessibility
- **Right Thing**: Moral obligation to make health apps accessible

### Consequences
- **Positive**: Broader user base, better user experience for all
- **Negative**: Additional development time and testing requirements
- **Implementation**: VoiceOver support, Dynamic Type, haptic feedback, high contrast

### Alternatives Considered
- **Basic Accessibility**: Minimum compliance only
- **Post-MVP Addition**: Would require significant refactoring
